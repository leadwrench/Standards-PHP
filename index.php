<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>

<p>As PHP has no canonical standards, this document seeks to provide a framework for guiding developers working with
LeadWrench to deliver maintainable, self-documenting code that satisfies the goals and objectives of the project.
Authoritative sources are used where possible, but in the event of confusion or conflicts, consult with the
<a href="mailto:dom@leadwrench.com">VP of Engineering</a> to provide definitive direction.</p>

    <div id="code_style_guide">
    <h1 id="code_style_guide_title">Code Style Guide</h1>

<p>The PHP community is large and diverse, composed of innumerable libraries, frameworks, and components. It is common
for PHP developers to choose several of these and combine them into a single project. It is important that PHP code
adhere (as close as possible) to a common code style to make it easy for developers to mix and match various libraries
for their projects.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.php-fig.org/">Framework Interop Group</a> has proposed and approved a series of style
recommendations. Not all of them related to code-style, but those that do are
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md">PSR-1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md">PSR-2</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md">PSR-4</a>.
These recommendations are merely a set of rules that some projects like Drupal, Zend, Symfony, CakePHP, phpBB, and
others have adopted (or are adopting) to allow for interoperability and maintainability across projects and developers.
</p>

<p>Using coding standards means other developers can easily read and work with your code, and applications that
implement the components can have consistency even when working with lots of third-party code. Accordingly, LeadWrench
requires adherence to the following standards:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">Read about PSR-0</a></li>

    <h2 id="programming_paradigms_title">Programming Paradigms</h2>

<p>PHP is a flexible, dynamic language that supports a variety of programming techniques. It has evolved dramatically over the years, notably adding a solid object-oriented model in PHP 5.0 (2004), anonymous functions and namespaces in PHP 5.3 (2009), and traits in PHP 5.4 (2012).</p>

<h3 id="objectoriented_programming">Object-oriented Programming</h3>

<p>PHP has a very complete set of object-oriented programming features including support for classes, abstract classes, interfaces, inheritance, constructors, cloning, exceptions, and more.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="functional_programming">Functional Programming</h3>

<p>PHP supports first-class function, meaning that a function can be assigned to a variable. Both user-defined and built-in functions can be referenced by a variable and invoked dynamically. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions (feature called Higher-order functions) and function can return other functions.</p>

<p>Recursion, a feature that allows a function to call itself is supported by the language, but most of the PHP code focus on iteration.</p>

<p>New anonymous functions (with support for closures) are present since PHP 5.3 (2009).</p>

<p>PHP 5.4 added the ability to bind closures to an object’s scope and also improved support for callables such that they can be used interchangeably with anonymous functions in almost all cases.</p>

<h3 id="meta_programming">Meta Programming</h3>

<p>PHP supports various forms of meta-programming through mechanisms like the Reflection API and Magic Methods. There are many Magic Methods available like <code>__get()</code>, <code>__set()</code>, <code>__clone()</code>, <code>__toString()</code>, <code>__invoke()</code>, etc. that allow developers to hook into class behavior. Ruby developers often say that PHP is lacking <code>method_missing</code>, but it is available as <code>__call()</code> and <code>__callStatic()</code>.</p>

</ul>
    </div>


    <div id="namespaces">
    <h2 id="namespaces_title">Namespaces</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, the PHP community has a lot of developers creating lots of code. This means that one library’s PHP code may use the same class name as another library. When both libraries are used in the same namespace, they collide and cause trouble.</p>

<p><em>Namespaces</em> solve this problem. As described in the PHP reference manual, namespaces may be compared to operating system directories that <em>namespace</em> files; two files with the same name may co-exist in separate directories. Likewise, two PHP classes with the same name may co-exist in separate PHP namespaces. It’s as simple as that.</p>

<p>It is important for you to namespace your code so that it may be used by other developers without fear of colliding with other libraries.</p>

<p>One recommended way to use namespaces is outlined in <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md">PSR-0</a>, which aims to provide a standard file, class and namespace convention to allow plug-and-play code.</p>

<p>In December 2013 the PHP-FIG created a new autoloading standard: <a href="https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md">PSR-4</a>, which one day will probably replace PSR-0. Currently both are still usable, as PSR-4 requires PHP 5.3 and many PHP 5.2-only projects currently implement PSR-0. If you’re going to use an autoloader standard for a new application or package then you almost certainly want to look into PSR-4.</p>

    <div id="standard_php_library">
    <h2 id="standard_php_library_title">Standard PHP Library</h2>

<p>The Standard PHP Library (SPL) is packaged with PHP and provides a collection of classes and interfaces. It is made up primarily of commonly needed datastructure classes (stack, queue, heap, and so on), and iterators which can traverse over these datastructures or your own classes which implement SPL interfaces.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.spl.php">Read about the SPL</a></li>
</ul>
    </div>


    <div id="command_line_interface">
    <h2 id="command_line_interface_title">Command Line Interface</h2>

<p>PHP was created primarily to write web applications, but it’s also useful for scripting command line interface (CLI) programs. Command line PHP programs can help you automate common tasks like testing, deployment, and application administrivia.</p>

<p>CLI PHP programs are powerful because you can use your app’s code directly without having to create and secure a web GUI for it. Just be sure not to put your CLI PHP scripts in your public web root!</p>

<p>Try running PHP from your command line:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>&gt; php -i
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>-i</code> option will print your PHP configuration just like the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.phpinfo.php"><code>phpinfo</code></a> function.</p>

<p>The <code>-a</code> option provides an interactive shell, similar to ruby’s IRB or python’s interactive shell. There are a number of other useful <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.options.php">command line options</a>, too.</p>

<p>Let’s write a simple “Hello, $name” CLI program. To try it out, create a file named <code>hello.php</code>, as below.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>if</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$argc</span> <span class='o'>!=</span> <span class='mi'>2</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Usage: php hello.php [name].</span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
    <span class='k'>exit</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='nv'>$name</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nv'>$argv</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>];</span>
<span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Hello, </span><span class='si'>$name</span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>PHP sets up two special variables based on the arguments your script is run with. <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argc.php"><code>$argc</code></a> is an integer variable containing the argument <em>count</em> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.argv.php"><code>$argv</code></a> is an array variable containing each argument’s <em>value</em>. The first argument is always the name of your PHP script file, in this case <code>hello.php</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>exit()</code> expression is used with a non-zero number to let the shell know that the command failed. Commonly used exit codes can be found <a href="http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?section=3&topic=sysexits">here</a></p>

<p>To run our script, above, from the command line:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='bash'>&gt; php hello.php
Usage: php hello.php <span class='o'>[</span>name<span class='o'>]</span>
&gt; php hello.php world
Hello, world

    <div id="xdebug">
    <h2 id="xdebug_title">XDebug</h2>

<p>One of the most useful tools in software development is a proper debugger. It allows you to trace the execution of your code and monitor the contents of the stack. XDebug, PHP’s debugger, can be utilized by various IDEs to provide Breakpoints and stack inspection. It can also allow tools like PHPUnit and KCacheGrind to perform code coverage analysis and code profiling.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in a bind, willing to resort to var_dump/print_r, and you still can’t find the solution - maybe you need to use the debugger.</p>

<p><a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/install">Installing XDebug</a> can be tricky, but one of its most important features is “Remote Debugging” - if you develop code locally and then test it inside a VM or on another server, Remote Debugging is the feature that you will want to enable right away.</p>

<p>Traditionally, you will modify your Apache VHost or .htaccess file with these values:</p>

<pre><code>php_value xdebug.remote_host=192.168.?.?
php_value xdebug.remote_port=9000</code></pre>

<p>The “remote host” and “remote port” will correspond to your local computer and the port that you configure your IDE to listen on. Then it’s just a matter of putting your IDE into “listen for connections” mode, and loading the URL:</p>

<pre><code>http://your-website.example.com/index.php?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=1</code></pre>

<p>Your IDE will now intercept the current state as the script executes, allowing you to set breakpoints and probe the values in memory.</p>

<p>Graphical debuggers make it very easy to step through code, inspect variables, and eval code against the live runtime. Many IDE’s have built-in or plugin-based support for graphical debugging with xdebug. MacGDBp is a free, open-source, stand-alone xdebug GUI for Mac.</p>

    <div id="dependency_management">
    <h1 id="dependency_management_title">Dependency Management</h1>

<p>There are a ton of PHP libraries, frameworks, and components to choose from. Your project will likely use several of them — these are project dependencies. Until recently, PHP did not have a good way to manage these project dependencies. Even if you managed them manually, you still had to worry about autoloaders. No more.</p>

<p>Currently there are two major package management systems for PHP - Composer and PEAR. Which one is right for you? The answer is both.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use <strong>Composer</strong> when managing dependencies for a single project.</li>

<li>Use <strong>PEAR</strong> when managing dependencies for PHP as a whole on your system.</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, Composer packages will be available only in the projects that you explicitly specify whereas a PEAR package would be available to all of your PHP projects. While PEAR might sound like the easier approach at first glance, there are advantages to using a project-by-project approach to your dependencies.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="composer_and_packagist">
    <h2 id="composer_and_packagist_title">Composer and Packagist</h2>

<p>Composer is a <strong>brilliant</strong> dependency manager for PHP. List your project’s dependencies in a <code>composer.json</code> file and, with a few simple commands, Composer will automatically download your project’s dependencies and setup autoloading for you.</p>

<p>There are already a lot of PHP libraries that are compatible with Composer, ready to be used in your project. These “packages” are listed on <a href="http://packagist.org/">Packagist</a>, the official repository for Composer-compatible PHP libraries.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_install_composer">How to Install Composer</h3>

<p>You can install Composer locally (in your current working directory; though this is no longer recommended) or globally (e.g. /usr/local/bin). Let’s assume you want to install Composer locally. From your project’s root directory:</p>

<pre><code>curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php</code></pre>

<p>This will download <code>composer.phar</code> (a PHP binary archive). You can run this with <code>php</code> to manage your project dependencies. <strong>Please Note:</strong> If you pipe downloaded code directly into an interpreter, please read the code online first to confirm it is safe.</p>

<h4 id="installing_on_windows">Installing on Windows</h4>

<p>For Windows users the easiest way to get up and running is to use the <a href="https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe">ComposerSetup</a> installer, which performs a global install and sets up your <code>$PATH</code> so that you can just call <code>composer</code> from any directory in your command line.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_install_composer_manually">How to Install Composer (manually)</h3>

<p>Manually installing Composer is an advanced technique; however, there are various reasons why a developer might prefer this method vs. using the interactive installation routine. The interactive installation checks your PHP installation to ensure that:</p>

<ul>
<li>a sufficient version of PHP is being used</li>

<li><code>.phar</code> files can be executed correctly</li>

<li>certain directory permissions are sufficient</li>

<li>certain problematic extensions are not loaded</li>

<li>certain <code>php.ini</code> settings are set</li>
</ul>

<p>Since a manual installation performs none of these checks, you have to decide whether the trade-off is worth it for you. As such, below is how to obtain Composer manually:</p>

<pre><code>curl -s https://getcomposer.org/composer.phar -o $HOME/local/bin/composer
chmod +x $HOME/local/bin/composer</code></pre>

<p>The path <code>$HOME/local/bin</code> (or a directory of your choice) should be in your <code>$PATH</code> environment variable. This will result in a <code>composer</code> command being available.</p>

<p>When you come across documentation that states to run Composer as <code>php composer.phar install</code>, you can substitute that with:</p>

<pre><code>composer install</code></pre>

<p>This section will assume you have installed composer globally.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_define_and_install_dependencies">How to Define and Install Dependencies</h3>

<p>Composer keeps track of your project’s dependencies in a file called <code>composer.json</code>. You can manage it by hand if you like, or use Composer itself. The <code>composer require</code> command adds a project dependency and if you don’t have a <code>composer.json</code> file, one will be created. Here’s an example that adds <a href="http://twig.sensiolabs.org">Twig</a> as a dependency of your project.</p>

<pre><code>composer require twig/twig:~1.8</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively the <code>composer init</code> command will guide you through creating a full <code>composer.json</code> file for your project. Either way, once you’ve created your <code>composer.json</code> file you can tell Composer to download and install your dependencies into the <code>vendors/</code> directory. This also applies to projects you’ve downloaded that already provide a <code>composer.json</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>composer install</code></pre>

<p>Next, add this line to your application’s primary PHP file; this will tell PHP to use Composer’s autoloader for your project dependencies.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>require</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;vendor/autoload.php&#39;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now you can use your project dependencies, and they’ll be autoloaded on demand.</p>

<h3 id="updating_your_dependencies">Updating your dependencies</h3>

<p>Composer creates a file called <code>composer.lock</code> which stores the exact version of each package it downloaded when you first ran <code>php composer.phar install</code>. If you share your project with other coders and the <code>composer.lock</code> file is part of your distribution, when they run <code>php composer.phar install</code> they’ll get the same versions as you. To update your dependencies, run <code>php composer.phar update</code>.</p>

<p>This is most useful when you define your version requirements flexibly. For instance a version requirement of ~1.8 means “anything newer than 1.8.0, but less than 2.0.x-dev”. You can also use the <code>*</code> wildcard as in <code>1.8.*</code>. Now Composer’s <code>php composer.phar update</code> command will upgrade all your dependencies to the newest version that fits the restrictions you define.</p>

<h3 id="update_notifications">Update Notifications</h3>

<p>To receive notifications about new version releases you can sign up for <a href="https://www.versioneye.com/">VersionEye</a>, a web service that can monitor your GitHub and BitBucket accounts for <code>composer.json</code> files and send emails with new package releases.</p>

<h3 id="checking_your_dependencies_for_security_issues">Checking your dependencies for security issues</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://security.sensiolabs.org/">Security Advisories Checker</a> is a web service and a command-line tool, both will examine your <code>composer.lock</code> file and tell you if you need to update any of your dependencies.</p>

    </div>


    <div id="pear">
    <h2 id="pear_title">PEAR</h2>

<p>Another veteran package manager that many PHP developers enjoy is <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>. It behaves much the same way as Composer, but has some notable differences.</p>

<p>PEAR requires each package to have a specific structure, which means that the author of the package must prepare it for usage with PEAR. Using a project which was not prepared to work with PEAR is not possible.</p>

<p>PEAR installs packages globally, which means after installing them once they are available to all projects on that server. This can be good if many projects rely on the same package with the same version but might lead to problems if version conflicts between two projects arise.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_install_pear">How to install PEAR</h3>

<p>You can install PEAR by downloading the phar installer and executing it. The PEAR documentation has detailed <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.getting.php">install instructions</a> for every operating system.</p>

<p>If you are using Linux, you can also have a look at your distribution package manager. Debian and Ubuntu, for example, have an apt <code>php-pear</code> package.</p>

<h3 id="how_to_install_a_package">How to install a package</h3>

<p>If the package is listed on the <a href="http://pear.php.net/packages.php">PEAR packages list</a>, you can install it by specifying the official name:</p>

<pre><code>pear install foo</code></pre>

<p>If the package is hosted on another channel, you need to <code>discover</code> the channel first and also specify it when installing. See the <a href="http://pear.php.net/manual/en/guide.users.commandline.channels.php">Using channel docs</a> for more information on this topic.</p>

<h3 id="handling_pear_dependencies_with_composer">Handling PEAR dependencies with Composer</h3>

<p>If you are already using <a href="/#composer_and_packagist">Composer</a> and you would like to install some PEAR code too, you can use Composer to handle your PEAR dependencies. This example will install code from <code>pear2.php.net</code>:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='json'><span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='nt'>&quot;repositories&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='p'>[</span>
        <span class='p'>{</span>
            <span class='nt'>&quot;type&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;pear&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span>
            <span class='nt'>&quot;url&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;http://pear2.php.net&quot;</span>
        <span class='p'>}</span>
    <span class='p'>],</span>
    <span class='nt'>&quot;require&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
        <span class='nt'>&quot;pear-pear2/PEAR2_Text_Markdown&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;*&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span>
        <span class='nt'>&quot;pear-pear2/PEAR2_HTTP_Request&quot;</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;*&quot;</span>
    <span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first section <code>&quot;repositories&quot;</code> will be used to let Composer know it should “initialise” (or “discover” in PEAR terminology) the pear repo. Then the require section will prefix the package name like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>pear-channel/Package</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The “pear” prefix is hardcoded to avoid any conflicts, as a pear channel could be the same as another packages vendor name for example, then the channel short name (or full URL) can be used to reference which channel the package is in.</p>

<p>When this code is installed it will be available in your vendor directory and automatically available through the Composer autoloader:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>vendor/pear-pear2.php.net/PEAR2_HTTP_Request/pear2/HTTP/Request.php</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To use this PEAR package simply reference it like so:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>$request = new pear2\HTTP\Request();</span>
</code></pre></div>

    <h2 id="the_basics_title">The Basics</h2>

<p>PHP is a vast language that allows coders of all levels the ability to produce code not only quickly, but efficiently. However while advancing through the language, we often forget the basics that we first learnt (or overlooked) in favor of short cuts and/or bad habits. To help combat this common issue, this section is aimed at reminding coders of the basic coding practices within PHP.</p>

    <div id="date_and_time">
    <h2 id="date_and_time_title">Date and Time</h2>

<p>PHP has a class named DateTime to help you when reading, writing, comparing or calculating with date and time. There are many date and time related functions in PHP besides DateTime, but it provides nice object-oriented interface to most common uses. It can handle time zones, but that is outside this short introduction.</p>

<p>To start working with DateTime, convert raw date and time string to an object with <code>createFromFormat()</code> factory method or do <code>new \DateTime</code> to get the current date and time. Use <code>format()</code> method to convert DateTime back to a string for output.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='nv'>$raw</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;22. 11. 1968&#39;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='nv'>$start</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>\DateTime</span><span class='o'>::</span><span class='na'>createFromFormat</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;d. m. Y&#39;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nv'>$raw</span><span class='p'>);</span>

<span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;Start date: &#39;</span> <span class='o'>.</span> <span class='nv'>$start</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>format</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;m/d/Y&#39;</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='o'>.</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Calculating with DateTime is possible with the DateInterval class. DateTime has methods like <code>add()</code> and <code>sub()</code> that take a DateInterval as an argument. Do not write code that expect same number of seconds in every day, both daylight saving and timezone alterations will break that assumption. Use date intervals instead. To calculate date difference use the <code>diff()</code> method. It will return new DateInterval, which is super easy to display.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='c1'>// create a copy of $start and add one month and 6 days</span>
<span class='nv'>$end</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>clone</span> <span class='nv'>$start</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='nv'>$end</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>add</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>\DateInterval</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;P1M6D&#39;</span><span class='p'>));</span>

<span class='nv'>$diff</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nv'>$end</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>diff</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$start</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='s1'>&#39;Difference: &#39;</span> <span class='o'>.</span> <span class='nv'>$diff</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>format</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;%m month, %d days (total: %a days)&#39;</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='o'>.</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='c1'>// Difference: 1 month, 6 days (total: 37 days)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>On DateTime objects you can use standard comparison:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>if</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$start</span> <span class='o'>&lt;</span> <span class='nv'>$end</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='k'>echo</span> <span class='s2'>&quot;Start is before end!</span><span class='se'>\n</span><span class='s2'>&quot;</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>One last example to demonstrate the DatePeriod class. It is used to iterate over recurring events. It can take two DateTime objects, start and end, and the interval for which it will return all events in between.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='c1'>// output all thursdays between $start and $end</span>
<span class='nv'>$periodInterval</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>\DateInterval</span><span class='o'>::</span><span class='na'>createFromDateString</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;first thursday&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='nv'>$periodIterator</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>\DatePeriod</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$start</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nv'>$periodInterval</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nv'>$end</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nx'>\DatePeriod</span><span class='o'>::</span><span class='na'>EXCLUDE_START_DATE</span><span class='p'>);</span>

    <h2 id="design_patterns_title">Design Patterns</h2>

<p>When you are building your application it is helpful to use common patterns in your code and common patterns for the overall structure of your project. Using common patterns is helpful because it makes it much easier to manage your code and lets other developers quickly understand how everything fits together.</p>

<p>If you use a framework then most of the higher level code and project structure will be based on that framework, so a lot of the pattern decisions are made for you. But it is still up to you to pick out the best patterns to follow in the code you build on top of the framework. If, on the other hand, you are not using a framework to build your application then you have to find the patterns that best suit the type and size of application that you’re building.</p>

    <div id="php_and_utf8">
    <h2 id="php_and_utf8_title">PHP and UTF-8</h2>

<p><em>This section was originally written by <a href="https://alexcabal.com/">Alex Cabal</a> over at <a href="https://phpbestpractices.org/#utf-8">PHP Best Practices</a> and has now been shared here</em>.</p>

<h3 id="theres_no_oneliner_be_careful_detailed_and_consistent">There’s no one-liner. Be careful, detailed, and consistent.</h3>

<p>Right now PHP does not support Unicode at a low level. There are ways to ensure that UTF-8 strings are processed OK, but it’s not easy, and it requires digging in to almost all levels of the web app, from HTML to SQL to PHP. We’ll aim for a brief, practical summary.</p>

<h3 id="utf8_at_the_php_level">UTF-8 at the PHP level</h3>

<p>The basic string operations, like concatenating two strings and assigning strings to variables, don’t need anything special for UTF-8. However most string functions, like <code>strpos()</code> and <code>strlen()</code>, do need special consideration. These functions often have an <code>mb_*</code> counterpart: for example, <code>mb_strpos()</code> and <code>mb_strlen()</code>. Together, these counterpart functions are called the Multibyte String Functions. The multibyte string functions are specifically designed to operate on Unicode strings.</p>

<p>You must use the <code>mb_*</code> functions whenever you operate on a Unicode string. For example, if you use <code>substr()</code> on a UTF-8 string, there’s a good chance the result will include some garbled half-characters. The correct function to use would be the multibyte counterpart, <code>mb_substr()</code>.</p>

<p>The hard part is remembering to use the <code>mb_*</code> functions at all times. If you forget even just once, your Unicode string has a chance of being garbled during further processing.</p>

<p>Not all string functions have an <code>mb_*</code> counterpart. If there isn’t one for what you want to do, then you might be out of luck.</p>

<p>Additionally, you should use the <code>mb_internal_encoding()</code> function at the top of every PHP script you write (or at the top of your global include script), and the <code>mb_http_output()</code> function right after it if your script is outputting to a browser. Explicitly defining the encoding of your strings in every script will save you a lot of headaches down the road.</p>

<p>Finally, many PHP functions that operate on strings have an optional parameter letting you specify the character encoding. You should always explicitly indicate UTF-8 when given the option. For example, <code>htmlentities()</code> has an option for character encoding, and you should always specify UTF-8 if dealing with such strings.</p>

<p>Note that as of PHP 5.4.0, UTF-8 is the default encoding for <code>htmlentities()</code> and <code>htmlspecialchars()</code>.</p>

<h3 id="utf8_at_the_database_level">UTF-8 at the Database level</h3>

<p>If your PHP script accesses MySQL, there’s a chance your strings could be stored as non-UTF-8 strings in the database even if you follow all of the precautions above.</p>

<p>To make sure your strings go from PHP to MySQL as UTF-8, make sure your database and tables are all set to the <code>utf8mb4</code> character set and collation, and that you use the <code>utf8mb4</code> character set in the PDO connection string. See example code below. This is <em>critically important</em>.</p>

<p>Note that you must use the <code>utf8mb4</code> character set for complete UTF-8 support, not the <code>utf8</code> character set! See Further Reading for why.</p>

<h3 id="utf8_at_the_browser_level">UTF-8 at the browser level</h3>

<p>Use the <code>mb_http_output()</code> function to ensure that your PHP script outputs UTF-8 strings to your browser. In your HTML, include the <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/docs/enduser-utf8.html">charset <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag</a> in your page’s <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> tag.</p>

    <div id="dependency_injection">
    <h1 id="dependency_injection_title">Dependency Injection</h1>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows the removal of hard-coded dependencies and makes it possible to change them, whether at run-time or compile-time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote makes the concept sound much more complicated than it actually is. Dependency Injection is providing a component with its dependencies either through constructor injection, method calls or the setting of properties. It is that simple.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="basic_concept">
    <h2 id="basic_concept_title">Basic Concept</h2>

<p>We can demonstrate the concept with a simple, yet naive example.</p>

<p>Here we have a <code>Database</code> class that requires an adapter to speak to the database. We instantiate the adapter in the constructor and create a hard dependency. This makes testing difficult and means the <code>Database</code> class is very tightly coupled to the adapter.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>namespace</span> <span class='nx'>Database</span><span class='p'>;</span>

<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>Database</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='k'>protected</span> <span class='nv'>$adapter</span><span class='p'>;</span>

    <span class='k'>public</span> <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='nf'>__construct</span><span class='p'>()</span>
    <span class='p'>{</span>
        <span class='nv'>$this</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>adapter</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>MySqlAdapter</span><span class='p'>;</span>
    <span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>

<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>MysqlAdapter</span> <span class='p'>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code can be refactored to use Dependency Injection and therefore loosen the dependency.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>namespace</span> <span class='nx'>Database</span><span class='p'>;</span>

<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>Database</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='k'>protected</span> <span class='nv'>$adapter</span><span class='p'>;</span>

    <span class='k'>public</span> <span class='k'>function</span> <span class='nf'>__construct</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>MySqlAdapter</span> <span class='nv'>$adapter</span><span class='p'>)</span>
    <span class='p'>{</span>
        <span class='nv'>$this</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>adapter</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nv'>$adapter</span><span class='p'>;</span>
    <span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>

<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>MysqlAdapter</span> <span class='p'>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now we are giving the <code>Database</code> class its dependency rather than it creating it itself. We could even create a method that would accept an argument of the dependency and set it that way, or if the <code>$adapter</code> property was <code>public</code> we could set it directly.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="complex_problem">
    <h2 id="complex_problem_title">Complex Problem</h2>

<p>If you have ever read about Dependency Injection then you have probably seen the terms <em>“Inversion of Control”</em> or <em>“Dependency Inversion Principle”</em>. These are the complex problems that Dependency Injection solves.</p>

<h3 id="inversion_of_control">Inversion of Control</h3>

<p>Inversion of Control is as it says, “inverting the control” of a system by keeping organisational control entirely separate from our objects. In terms of Dependency Injection, this means loosening our dependencies by controlling and instantiating them elsewhere in the system.</p>

<p>For years, PHP frameworks have been achieving Inversion of Control, however, the question became, which part of control are you inverting, and where to? For example, MVC frameworks would generally provide a super object or base controller that other controllers must extend to gain access to its dependencies. This <strong>is</strong> Inversion of Control, however, instead of loosening dependencies, this method simply moved them.</p>

<p>Dependency Injection allows us to more elegantly solve this problem by only injecting the dependencies we need, when we need them, without the need for any hard coded dependencies at all.</p>

<h3 id="dependency_inversion_principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</h3>

<p>Dependency Inversion Principle is the “D” in the S.O.L.I.D set of object oriented design principles that states one should <em>“Depend on Abstractions. Do not depend on concretions.”</em>. Put simply, this means our dependencies should be interfaces/contracts or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations. We can easily refactor the above example to follow this principle.</p>

<p>There are several benefits to the <code>Database</code> class now depending on an interface rather than a concretion.</p>

<p>Consider that you are working in a team and the adapter is being worked on by a colleague. In our first example, we would have to wait for said colleague to finish the adapter before we could properly mock it for our unit tests. Now that the dependency is an interface/contract we can happily mock that interface knowing that our colleague will build the adapter based on that contract.</p>

<p>An even bigger benefit to this method is that our code is now much more scalable. If a year down the line we decide that we want to migrate to a different type of database, we can write an adapter that implements the original interface and inject that instead, no more refactoring would be required as we can ensure that the adapter follows the contract set by the interface.</p>

    <div id="containers">
    <h2 id="containers_title">Containers</h2>

<p>The first thing you should understand about Dependency Injection Containers is that they are not the same thing as Dependency Injection. A container is a convenience utility that helps us implement Dependency Injection, however, they can be and often are misused to implement an anti-pattern, Service Location. Injecting a DI container as a Service Locator in to your classes arguably creates a harder dependency on the container than the dependency you are replacing. It also makes your code much less transparent and ultimately harder to test.</p>

<p>Most modern frameworks have their own Dependency Injection Container that allows you to wire your dependencies together through configuration. What this means in practice is that you can write application code that is as clean and de-coupled as the framework it is built on.</p>

    <div id="databases">
    <h1 id="databases_title">Databases</h1>

<p>Many times your PHP code will use a database to persist information. You have a few options to connect and interact with your database. The recommended option <em>until PHP 5.1.0</em> was to use native drivers such as <a href="http://php.net/mysql">mysql</a>, <a href="http://php.net/mysqli">mysqli</a>, <a href="http://php.net/pgsql">pgsql</a>, etc.</p>

<p>Native drivers are great if you are only using ONE database in your application, but if, for example, you are using MySQL and a little bit of MSSQL, or you need to connect to an Oracle database, then you will not be able to use the same drivers. You’ll need to learn a brand new API for each database — and that can get silly.</p>

<p>As an extra note on native drivers, the mysql extension for PHP is no longer in active development, and is officially deprecated as of PHP 5.5, meaning that it will be removed within the next few releases. If you are using <code>mysql_connect()</code> and <code>mysql_query()</code> in your applications then you will be faced with a rewrite at some point down the line, so the best option is to replace mysql usage with mysqli or PDO in your applications within your own development schedules so you won’t be rushed later on. <em>If you are starting from scratch then absolutely do not use the mysql extension: use the <a href="http://php.net/mysqli">MySQLi extension</a>, or use PDO.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/mysqlinfo.api.choosing.php">PHP: Choosing an API for MySQL</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="pdo">PDO</h2>

<p>PDO is a database connection abstraction library — built into PHP since 5.1.0 — that provides a common interface to talk with many different databases. PDO will not translate your SQL queries or emulate missing features; it is purely for connecting to multiple types of database with the same API.</p>

<p>More importantly, <code>PDO</code> allows you to safely inject foreign input (e.g. IDs) into your SQL queries without worrying about database SQL injection attacks. This is possible using PDO statements and bound parameters.</p>

<p>Let’s assume a PHP script receives a numeric ID as a query parameter. This ID should be used to fetch a user record from a database. This is the <code>wrong</code> way to do this:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='nv'>$pdo</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>PDO</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;sqlite:users.db&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='nv'>$pdo</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>query</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s2'>&quot;SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = &quot;</span> <span class='o'>.</span> <span class='nv'>$_GET</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s1'>&#39;id&#39;</span><span class='p'>]);</span> <span class='c1'>// &lt;-- NO!</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is terrible code. You are inserting a raw query parameter into a SQL query. This will get you hacked in a heartbeat. Just imagine if a hacker passes in an inventive <code>id</code> parameter by calling a URL like <code>http://domain.com/?id=1%3BDELETE+FROM+users</code>. This will set the <code>$_GET[&#39;id&#39;]</code> variable to <code>1;DELETE FROM users</code> which will delete all of your users! Instead, you should sanitize the ID input using PDO bound parameters.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='nv'>$pdo</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>PDO</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;sqlite:users.db&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='nv'>$stmt</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nv'>$pdo</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>prepare</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;SELECT name FROM users WHERE id = :id&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='nv'>$stmt</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>bindParam</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;:id&#39;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nv'>$_GET</span><span class='p'>[</span><span class='s1'>&#39;id&#39;</span><span class='p'>],</span> <span class='nx'>PDO</span><span class='o'>::</span><span class='na'>PARAM_INT</span><span class='p'>);</span> <span class='c1'>// &lt;-- Automatically sanitized by PDO</span>
<span class='nv'>$stmt</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>execute</span><span class='p'>();</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is correct code. It uses a bound parameter on a PDO statement. This escapes the foreign input ID before it is introduced to the database preventing potential SQL injection attacks.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php">Learn about PDO</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You should also be aware that database connections use up resources and it was not unheard-of to have resources exhausted if connections were not implicitly closed, however this was more common in other languages. Using PDO you can implicitly close the connection by destroying the object by ensuring all remaining references to it are deleted, i.e. set to NULL. If you don’t do this explicitly, PHP will automatically close the connection when your script ends - unless of course you are using persistent connections.</p>

    <div id="errors_and_exceptions">
    <h1 id="errors_and_exceptions_title">Errors and Exceptions</h1>
    </div>


    <div id="errors">
    <h2 id="errors_title">Errors</h2>

<p>In many “exception-heavy” programming languages, whenever anything goes wrong an exception will be thrown. This is certainly a viable way to do things, but PHP is an “exception-light” programming language. While it does have exceptions and more of the core is starting to use them when working with objects, most of PHP itself will try to keep processing regardless of what happens, unless a fatal error occurs.</p>

<p>For example:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>$ php -a</span>
<span class='x'>php &gt; echo $foo;</span>
<span class='x'>Notice: Undefined variable: foo in php shell code on line 1</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This is only a notice error, and PHP will happily carry on. This can be confusing for those coming from “exception-heavy” languages, because referencing a missing variable in Python for example will throw an exception:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='python'><span class='err'>$</span> <span class='n'>python</span>
<span class='o'>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class='k'>print</span> <span class='n'>foo</span>
<span class='n'>Traceback</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='n'>most</span> <span class='n'>recent</span> <span class='n'>call</span> <span class='n'>last</span><span class='p'>):</span>
  <span class='n'>File</span> <span class='s'>&quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='n'>line</span> <span class='mi'>1</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='ow'>in</span> <span class='o'>&lt;</span><span class='n'>module</span><span class='o'>&gt;</span>
<span class='ne'>NameError</span><span class='p'>:</span> <span class='n'>name</span> <span class='s'>&#39;foo&#39;</span> <span class='ow'>is</span> <span class='ow'>not</span> <span class='n'>defined</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The only real difference is that Python will freak out over any small thing, so that developers can be super sure any potential issue or edge-case is caught, whereas PHP will keep on processing unless something extreme happens, at which point it will throw an error and report it.</p>

<h3 id="error_severity">Error Severity</h3>

<p>PHP has several levels of error severity. The three most common types of messages are errors, notices and warnings. These have different levels of severity; <code>E_ERROR</code>, <code>E_NOTICE</code>, and <code>E_WARNING</code>. Errors are fatal run-time errors and are usually caused by faults in your code and need to be fixed as they’ll cause PHP to stop executing. Warnings are non-fatal errors, execution of the script will not be halted. Notices are advisory messages caused by code that may or may not cause problems during the execution of the script, execution is not halted.</p>

<p>Another type of error message reported at compile time are <code>E_STRICT</code> messages. These messages are used to suggest changes to your code to help ensure best interoperability and forward compatibility with upcoming versions of PHP.</p>

<h3 id="changing_phps_error_reporting_behaviour">Changing PHP’s Error Reporting Behaviour</h3>

<p>Error Reporting can be changed by using PHP settings and/or PHP function calls. Using the built in PHP function <code>error_reporting()</code> you can set the level of errors for the duration of the script execution by passing one of the predefined error level constants, meaning if you only want to see Warnings and Errors - but not Notices - then you can configure that:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>error_reporting(E_ERROR | E_WARNING);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can also control whether or not errors are displayed to the screen (good for development) or hidden, and logged (good for production). For more information on this check out the <a href="/#error_reporting">Error Reporting</a> section.</p>

<h3 id="inline_error_suppression">Inline Error Suppression</h3>

<p>You can also tell PHP to suppress specific errors with the Error Control Operator <code>@</code>. You put this operator at the beginning of an expression, and any error that’s a direct result of the expression is silenced.</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>echo @$foo[&#39;bar&#39;];</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will output <code>$foo[&#39;bar&#39;]</code> if it exists, but will simply return a null and print nothing if the variable <code>$foo</code> or <code>&#39;bar&#39;</code> key does not exist. Without the error control operator, this expression could create a <code>PHP Notice:  Undefined variable: foo</code> or <code>PHP Notice:  Undefined index: bar</code> error.</p>

<p>This might seem like a good idea, but there are a few undesirable tradeoffs. PHP handles expressions using an <code>@</code> in a less performant way than expressions without an <code>@</code>. Premature optimization may be the root of all programming arguments, but if performance is particularly important for your application/library it’s important to understand the error control operator’s performance implications.</p>

<p>Secondly, the error control operator <strong>completely</strong> swallows the error. The error is not displayed, and the error is not send to the error log. Also, stock/production PHP systems have no way to turn off the error control operator. While you may be correct that the error you’re seeing is harmless, a different, less harmless error will be just as silent.</p>

<p>If there’s a way to avoid the error suppression operator, you should consider it. For example, our code above could be rewritten like this</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>echo isset($foo[&#39;bar&#39;]) ? $foo[&#39;bar&#39;] : &#39;&#39;;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>One instance where error suppression might make sense is where <code>fopen()</code> fails to find a file to load. You could check for the existence of the file before you try to load it, but if the file is deleted after the check and before the <code>fopen()</code> (which might sound impossible, but it can happen) then <code>fopen()</code> will return false <em>and</em> throw an error. This is potentially something PHP should resolve, but is one case where error suppression might seem like the only valid solution.</p>

<p>Earlier we mentioned there’s no way in a stock PHP system to turn off the error control operator. However, <a href="http://xdebug.org/docs/basic">xDebug</a> has an <code>xdebug.scream</code> ini setting which will disable the error control operator. You can set this via your <code>php.ini</code> file with the following.</p>

<pre><code>xdebug.scream = On</code></pre>

<p>You can also set this value at runtime with the <code>ini_set</code> function</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='x'>ini_set(&#39;xdebug.scream&#39;, &#39;1&#39;)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The ”<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.scream.php">Scream</a>” PHP extension offers similar functionality to xDebug’s, although Scream’s ini setting is named <code>scream.enabled</code>.</p>

<p>This is most useful when you’re debugging code and suspect an informative error is suppressed. Use scream with care, and as a temporary debugging tool. There’s lots of PHP library code that may not work with the error control operator disabled.</p>

<h3 id="errorexception">ErrorException</h3>

<p>PHP is perfectly capable of being an “exception-heavy” programming language, and only requires a few lines of code to make the switch. Basically you can throw your “errors” as “exceptions” using the <code>ErrorException</code> class, which extends the <code>Exception</code> class.</p>

<p>This is a common practice implemented by a large number of modern frameworks such as Symfony and Laravel. By default Laravel will display all errors as exceptions using the <a href="http://filp.github.io/whoops/">Whoops!</a> package if the <code>app.debug</code> switch is turned on, then hide them if the switch is turned off.</p>

<p>By throwing errors as exceptions in development you can handle them better than the usual result, and if you see an exception during development you can wrap it in a catch statement with specific instructions on how to handle the situation. Each exception you catch instantly makes your application that little bit more robust.</p>

<p>More information on this and details on how to use <code>ErrorException</code> with error handling can be found at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/class.errorexception.php">ErrorException Class</a>.</p>

    <div id="exceptions">
    <h2 id="exceptions_title">Exceptions</h2>

<p>Exceptions are a standard part of most popular programming languages, but they are often overlooked by PHP programmers. Languages like Ruby are extremely Exception heavy, so whenever something goes wrong such as a HTTP request failing, or a DB query goes wrong, or even if an image asset could not be found, Ruby (or the gems being used) will throw an exception to the screen meaning you instantly know there is a mistake.</p>

<p>PHP itself is fairly lax with this, and a call to <code>file_get_contents()</code> will usually just get you a <code>FALSE</code> and a warning. Many older PHP frameworks like CodeIgniter will just return a false, log a message to their proprietary logs and maybe let you use a method like <code>$this-&gt;upload-&gt;get_error()</code> to see what went wrong. The problem here is that you have to go looking for a mistake and check the docs to see what the error method is for this class, instead of having it made extremely obvious.</p>

<p>Another problem is when classes automatically throw an error to the screen and exit the process. When you do this you stop another developer from being able to dynamically handle that error. Exceptions should be thrown to make a developer aware of an error; they then can choose how to handle this. E.g.:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='nv'>$email</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='k'>new</span> <span class='nx'>Fuel\Email</span><span class='p'>;</span>
<span class='nv'>$email</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>subject</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;My Subject&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>

<span class='k'>try</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='nv'>$email</span><span class='o'>-&gt;</span><span class='na'>send</span><span class='p'>();</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='k'>catch</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>Fuel\Email\ValidationFailedException</span> <span class='nv'>$e</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='c1'>// The validation failed</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='k'>catch</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nx'>Fuel\Email\SendingFailedException</span> <span class='nv'>$e</span><span class='p'>)</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='c1'>// The driver could not send the email</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
<span class='nx'>finally</span>
<span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='c1'>// Executed regardless of whether an exception has been thrown, and before normal execution resumes</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="spl_exceptions">SPL Exceptions</h3>

<p>The generic <code>Exception</code> class provides very little debugging context for the developer; however, to remedy this, it is possible to create a specialized <code>Exception</code> type by sub-classing the generic <code>Exception</code> class:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='k'>class</span> <span class='nc'>ValidationException</span> <span class='k'>extends</span> <span class='nx'>Exception</span> <span class='p'>{}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means you can add multiple catch blocks and handle different Exceptions differently. This can lead to the creation of a <em>lot</em> of custom Exceptions, some of which could have been avoided using the SPL Exceptions provided in the <a href="/#standard_php_library">SPL extension</a>.</p>

<p>If for example you use the <code>__call()</code> Magic Method and an invalid method is requested then instead of throwing a standard Exception which is vague, or creating a custom Exception just for that, you could just <code>throw new BadMethodCallException;</code>.</p>

    <div id="password_hashing">
    <h2 id="password_hashing_title">Password Hashing</h2>

<p>Eventually everyone builds a PHP application that relies on user login. Usernames and passwords are stored in a database and later used to authenticate users upon login.</p>

<p>It is important that you properly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function"><em>hash</em></a> passwords before storing them. Password hashing is an irreversible, one way function performed against the user’s password. This produces a fixed-length string that cannot be feasibly reversed. This means you can compare a hash against another to determine if they both came from the same source string, but you cannot determine the original string. If passwords are not hashed and your database is accessed by an unauthorized third-party, all user accounts are now compromised. Some users may (unfortunately) use the same password for other services. Therefore, it is important to take security seriously.</p>

<p><strong>Hashing passwords with <code>password_hash</code></strong></p>

<p>In PHP 5.5 <code>password_hash</code> was introduced. At this time it is using BCrypt, the strongest algorithm currently supported by PHP. It will be updated in the future to support more algorithms as needed though. The <code>password_compat</code> library was created to provide forward compatibility for PHP &gt;= 5.3.7.</p>

<p>Below we hash a string, and then check the hash against a new string. Because our two source strings are different (‘secret-password’ vs. ‘bad-password’) this login will fail.</p>

    <div id="data_filtering">
    <h2 id="data_filtering_title">Data Filtering</h2>

<p>Never ever (ever) trust foreign input introduced to your PHP code. Always sanitize and validate foreign input before using it in code. The <code>filter_var</code> and <code>filter_input</code> functions can sanitize text and validate text formats (e.g. email addresses).</p>

<p>Foreign input can be anything: <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_POST</code> form input data, some values in the <code>$_SERVER</code> superglobal, and the HTTP request body via <code>fopen(&#39;php://input&#39;, &#39;r&#39;)</code>. Remember, foreign input is not limited to form data submitted by the user. Uploaded and downloaded files, session values, cookie data, and data from third-party web services are foreign input, too.</p>

<p>While foreign data can be stored, combined, and accessed later, it is still foreign input. Every time you process, output, concatenate, or include data in your code, ask yourself if the data is filtered properly and can it be trusted.</p>

<p>Data may be <em>filtered</em> differently based on its purpose. For example, when unfiltered foreign input is passed into HTML page output, it can execute HTML and JavaScript on your site! This is known as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can be a very dangerous attack. One way to avoid XSS is to sanitize all user-generated data before outputting it to your page by removing HTML tags with the <code>strip_tags</code> function or escaping characters with special meaning into their respective HTML entities with the <code>htmlentities</code> or <code>htmlspecialchars</code> functions.</p>

<p>Another example is passing options to be executed on the command line. This can be extremely dangerous (and is usually a bad idea), but you can use the built-in <code>escapeshellarg</code> function to sanitize the executed command’s arguments.</p>

<p>One last example is accepting foreign input to determine a file to load from the filesystem. This can be exploited by changing the filename to a file path. You need to remove “/”, “../”, <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/security.filesystem.nullbytes.php">null bytes</a>, or other characters from the file path so it can’t load hidden, non-public, or sensitive files.</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="sanitization">Sanitization</h3>

<p>Sanitization removes (or escapes) illegal or unsafe characters from foreign input.</p>

<p>For example, you should sanitize foreign input before including the input in HTML or inserting it into a raw SQL query. When you use bound parameters with <a href="#databases">PDO</a>, it will sanitize the input for you.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is required to allow some safe HTML tags in the input when including it in the HTML page. This is very hard to do and many avoid it by using other more restricted formatting like Markdown or BBCode, although whitelisting libraries like <a href="http://htmlpurifier.org/">HTML Purifier</a> exists for this reason.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php">See Sanitization Filters</a></p>

<h3 id="validation">Validation</h3>

<p>Validation ensures that foreign input is what you expect. For example, you may want to validate an email address, a phone number, or age when processing a registration submission.</p>

    <div id="configuration_files">
    <h2 id="configuration_files_title">Configuration Files</h2>

<p>When creating configuration files for your applications, best practices recommend that one of the following methods be followed:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is recommended that you store your configuration information where it cannot be accessed directly and pulled in via the file system.</li>

<li>If you must store your configuration files in the document root, name the files with a <code>.php</code> extension. This ensures that, even if the script is accessed directly, it will not be output as plain text.</li>

<li>Information in configuration files should be protected accordingly, either through encryption or group/user file system permissions</li>
</ul>
    </div>


    <div id="register_globals">
    <h2 id="register_globals_title">Register Globals</h2>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> As of PHP 5.4.0 the <code>register_globals</code> setting has been removed and can no longer be used. This is only included as a warning for anyone in the process of upgrading a legacy application.</p>

<p>When enabled, the <code>register_globals</code> configuration setting that makes several types of variables (including ones from <code>$_POST</code>, <code>$_GET</code> and <code>$_REQUEST</code>) available in the global scope of your application. This can easily lead to security issues as your application cannot effectively tell where the data is coming from.</p>

<p>For example: <code>$_GET[&#39;foo&#39;]</code> would be available via <code>$foo</code>, which can override variables that have not been declared. If you are using PHP &lt; 5.4.0 <strong>make sure</strong> that <code>register_globals</code> is <strong>off</strong>.</p>

    <div id="error_reporting">
    <h2 id="error_reporting_title">Error Reporting</h2>

<p>Error logging can be useful in finding the problem spots in your application, but it can also expose information about the structure of your application to the outside world. To effectively protect your application from issues that could be caused by the output of these messages, you need to configure your server differently in development versus production (live).</p>

<h3 id="development">Development</h3>

<p>To show every possible error during <strong>development</strong>, configure the following settings in your <code>php.ini</code>:</p>

<pre><code>display_errors = On
display_startup_errors = On
error_reporting = -1
log_errors = On</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Passing in the value <code>-1</code> will show every possible error, even when new levels and constants are added in future PHP versions. The <code>E_ALL</code> constant also behaves this way as of PHP 5.4. - <a href="http://php.net/manual/function.error-reporting.php">php.net</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>E_STRICT</code> error level constant was introduced in 5.3.0 and is not part of <code>E_ALL</code>, however it became part of <code>E_ALL</code> in 5.4.0. What does this mean? In terms of reporting every possible error in version 5.3 it means you must use either <code>-1</code> or <code>E_ALL | E_STRICT</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Reporting every possible error by PHP version</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>&lt; 5.3 <code>-1</code> or <code>E_ALL</code></li>

<li>  5.3 <code>-1</code> or <code>E_ALL | E_STRICT</code></li>

<li>&gt; 5.3 <code>-1</code> or <code>E_ALL</code></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="production">Production</h3>

<p>To hide errors on your <strong>production</strong> environment, configure your <code>php.ini</code> as:</p>

<pre><code>display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
error_reporting = E_ALL
log_errors = On</code></pre>

<p>With these settings in production, errors will still be logged to the error logs for the web server, but will not be shown to the user. For more information on these settings, see the PHP manual:</p>

    <div id="testing">
    <h1 id="testing_title">Testing</h1>

<p>Writing automated tests for your PHP code is considered a best practice and can lead to well-built applications. Automated tests are a great tool for making sure your application does not break when you are making changes or adding new functionality and should not be ignored.</p>

<p>There are several different types of testing tools (or frameworks) available for PHP, which use different approaches - all of which are trying to avoid manual testing and the need for large Quality Assurance teams, just to make sure recent changes didn’t break existing functionality.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="test_driven_development">
    <h2 id="test_driven_development_title">Test Driven Development</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes a failing automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces code to pass that test and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards. Kent Beck, who is credited with having developed or ‘rediscovered’ the technique, stated in 2003 that TDD encourages simple designs and inspires confidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are several different types of testing that you can do for your application</p>

<h3 id="unit_testing">Unit Testing</h3>

<p>Unit Testing is a programming approach to ensure functions, classes and methods are working as expected, from the point you build them all the way through the development cycle. By checking values going in and out of various functions and methods, you can make sure the internal logic is working correctly. By using Dependency Injection and building “mock” classes and stubs you can verify that dependencies are correctly used for even better test coverage.</p>

<p>When you create a class or function you should create a unit test for each behavior it must have. At a very basic level you should make sure it errors if you send it bad arguments and make sure it works if you send it valid arguments. This will help ensure that when you make changes to this class or function later on in the development cycle that the old functionality continues to work as expected. The only alternative to this would be var_dump() in a test.php, which is no way to build an application - large or small.</p>

<p>The other use for unit tests is contributing to open source. If you can write a test that shows broken functionality (i.e. fails), then fix it, and show the test passing, patches are much more likely to be accepted. If you run a project which accepts pull requests then you should suggest this as a requirement.</p>

<h3 id="integration_testing">Integration Testing</h3>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Integration testing (sometimes called Integration and Testing, abbreviated “I&amp;T”) is the phase in software testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group. It occurs after unit testing and before validation testing. Integration testing takes as its input modules that have been unit tested, groups them in larger aggregates, applies tests defined in an integration test plan to those aggregates, and delivers as its output the integrated system ready for system testing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Many of the same tools that can be used for unit testing can be used for integration testing as many of the same principles are used.</p>

<h3 id="functional_testing">Functional Testing</h3>

<p>Sometimes also known as acceptance testing, functional testing consists of using tools to create automated tests that actually use your application instead of just verifying that individual units of code are behaving correctly and that individual units can speak to each other correctly. These tools typically work using real data and simulating actual users of the application.</p>

    <div id="behavior_driven_development">
    <h2 id="behavior_driven_development_title">Behavior Driven Development</h2>

<p>There are two different types of Behavior-Driven Development (BDD): SpecBDD and StoryBDD. SpecBDD focuses on technical behavior of code, while StoryBDD focuses on business or feature behaviors or interactions. PHP has frameworks for both types of BDD.</p>

<p>With StoryBDD, you write human-readable stories that describe the behavior of your application. These stories can then be run as actual tests against your application. The framework used in PHP applications for StoryBDD is Behat, which is inspired by Ruby’s <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a> project and implements the Gherkin DSL for describing feature behavior.</p>

<p>With SpecBDD, you write specifications that describe how your actual code should behave. Instead of testing a function or method, you are describing how that function or method should behave. PHP offers the PHPSpec framework for this purpose. This framework is inspired by the <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec project</a> for Ruby.</p>

    <div id="caching">
    <h1 id="caching_title">Caching</h1>

<p>PHP is pretty quick by itself, but bottlenecks can arise when you make remote connections, load files, etc. Thankfully, there are various tools available to speed up certain parts of your application, or reduce the number of times these various time-consuming tasks need to run.</p>
    </div>


    <div id="bytecode_cache">
    <h2 id="bytecode_cache_title">Bytecode Cache</h2>

<p>When a PHP file is executed, under the hood it is first compiled to bytecode (also known as opcode) and, only then, the bytecode is executed. If a PHP file is not modified, the bytecode will always be the same. This means that the compilation step is a waste of CPU resources.</p>

<p>This is where Bytecode cache comes in. It prevents redundant compilation by storing bytecode in memory and reusing it on successive calls. Setting up bytecode cache is a matter of minutes, and your application will speed up significantly. There’s really no reason not to use it.</p>

<p>As of PHP 5.5, there is a built-in bytecode cache called <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.opcache.php">OPcache</a>. This is also available for earlier versions.</p>

<p>Other popular bytecodes caches are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.apc.php">APC</a> (PHP 5.4 and earlier)</li>

<li><a href="http://xcache.lighttpd.net/">XCache</a></li>

<li><a href="http://www.zend.com/products/server/">Zend Optimizer+</a> (part of Zend Server package)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.iis.net/download/wincacheforphp">WinCache</a> (extension for MS Windows Server)</li>
</ul>
    </div>


    <div id="object_caching">
    <h2 id="object_caching_title">Object Caching</h2>

<p>There are times when it can be beneficial to cache individual objects in your code, such as with data that is expensive to get or database calls where the result is unlikely to change. You can use object caching software to hold these pieces of data in memory for extremely fast access later on. If you save these items to a data store after you retrieve them, then pull them directly from the cache for following requests, you can gain a significant improvement in performance as well as reduce the load on your database servers.</p>

<p>Many of the popular bytecode caching solutions let you cache custom data as well, so there’s even more reason to take advantage of them. APCu, XCache, and WinCache all provide APIs to save data from your PHP code to their memory cache.</p>

<p>The most commonly used memory object caching systems are APCu and memcached. APCu is an excellent choice for object caching, it includes a simple API for adding your own data to its memory cache and is very easy to setup and use. The one real limitation of APCu is that it is tied to the server it’s installed on. Memcached on the other hand is installed as a separate service and can be accessed across the network, meaning that you can store objects in a hyper-fast data store in a central location and many different systems can pull from it.</p>

<p>Note that when running PHP as a (Fast-)CGI application inside your webserver, every PHP process will have its own cache, i.e. APCu data is not shared between your worker processes. In these cases, you might want to consider using memcached instead, as it’s not tied to the PHP processes.</p>

<p>In a networked configuration APCu will usually outperform memcached in terms of access speed, but memcached will be able to scale up faster and further. If you do not expect to have multiple servers running your application, or do not need the extra features that memcached offers then APCu is probably your best choice for object caching.</p>

<p>Example logic using APCu:</p>
<div class='highlight'><pre><code class='php'><span class='cp'>&lt;?php</span>
<span class='c1'>// check if there is data saved as &#39;expensive_data&#39; in cache</span>
<span class='nv'>$data</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nb'>apc_fetch</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;expensive_data&#39;</span><span class='p'>);</span>
<span class='k'>if</span> <span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$data</span> <span class='o'>===</span> <span class='k'>false</span><span class='p'>)</span> <span class='p'>{</span>
    <span class='c1'>// data is not in cache; save result of expensive call for later use</span>
    <span class='nb'>apc_add</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='s1'>&#39;expensive_data&#39;</span><span class='p'>,</span> <span class='nv'>$data</span> <span class='o'>=</span> <span class='nx'>get_expensive_data</span><span class='p'>());</span>
<span class='p'>}</span>

<span class='nb'>print_r</span><span class='p'>(</span><span class='nv'>$data</span><span class='p'>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Note that prior to PHP 5.5, APC provides both an object cache and a bytecode cache. APCu is a project to bring APC’s object cache to PHP 5.5+, since PHP now has a built-in bytecode cache (OPcache).</p>
